One thing we tried to work on:
- How can we gather data on plants?
- Tried multiple methods: NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and TreeCountSegHeight model
- Unfortunately, both weren't extremely successful.
- NDVI analysis was able to gather data on plants but we need more info, specifically the height of the plantst to be able to meaningfully use the data on plants.
- TreeCountSegHeight was an ML model we looked at for extracting this data. The issue we ran into with this model is that it's a big model that would slow down our energy model exponentially.

# Rhino Energy Prediction Plugin

## Overview

Rhino Energy Prediction Plugin is designed to support architects in making energy-informed design decisions early in the building process. The plugin enables users to create or modify building models and receive predictions for heating and cooling loads using a machine learning (ML) model. Architects can gauge building energy performance early (concept stage) using the Rhino Energy Prediction Plugin. The plugin embeds a self-contained ONNX runtime directly in Grasshopper.

## Features

- **Model Initialization**  
  Reads an ONNX model file path and sets up an `InferenceSession` that exposes each input tensor’s name, datatype, and shape.

- **Real-Time Inference**  
  Packs Grasshopper inputs into dense tensors, executes the ONNX model, and returns the first element of the output array as an energy load estimate.

- **Automatic Feature Extraction**  
  Companion Python script reads 3D building geometry and computes features such as roof area, window-to-wall ratio, floor area, and number of stories.

- **Pure C# Runtime**  
  Runs entirely in .NET via Microsoft’s ONNX Runtime—no Python interpreter required at inference time.

## Architecture

1. **Component Initialization**  
   The plugin reads the ONNX model path from the Grasshopper input.  
   It then creates an `InferenceSession` and retrieves input tensor metadata.

2. **Input Packing**  
   Grasshopper values are loaded into dense tensors that match the ONNX input shapes.

3. **Model Inference**  
   The plugin runs the ONNX model with the packed inputs and receives an output array.  
   The first element of that array is sent to the Grasshopper output.

4. **Feature Extraction Script**  
   A Python helper extracts building features automatically by classifying layers named `Wall`, `Slab`, `Window`, and `Roof`.

## Installation

1. Download the `VIP_Energy_Plugin` folder.  
2. Copy it to your Grasshopper Libraries folder:
   ```
   C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries
   ```
3. Launch Rhino and open Grasshopper.  
4. Drag the **VIPPlugin** component from the Params tab onto the canvas.  
5. Provide the ONNX model file path to the component input.  
6. View the energy load prediction on the second output parameter.

## Workflow

1. Open Rhino and start Grasshopper.  
2. Place the VIPPlugin component and connect the ONNX model path.  
3. Sketch or import a building mass in Rhino.  
4. Run the feature extraction script to compute geometry parameters.  
5. Grasshopper packs the inputs and runs the ONNX model.  
6. Inspect the real-time energy load estimate.

## Requirements

- **Rhino 7+** – Plugin host environment  
- **Windows OS** – .NET and Rhino SDK compatibility  
- **.NET Framework 4.8+** – ONNX Runtime support  
- **Python 3.8+** – Feature extraction and model conversion scripts  
- **ONNX model file** – Trained energy prediction model  

## Tech Stack

- **Rhino SDK (C#)** – Core plugin development and geometry handling  
- **Grasshopper (C#)** – Dynamic component architecture  
- **Microsoft ONNX Runtime** – High-performance model inference  
- **Python** – Building feature extraction and `.joblib` → `.onnx` conversion  
- **scikit-learn / sklearn-onnx** – Model training and conversion  

## Roadmap

- **Real-Time EUI Feedback**  
  Provide energy use intensity updates as users modify height, WWR, and story count.

- **Flexible Model Inputs**  
  Detect parameter names and types automatically to support multiple climates and typologies.

- **Multi-Format Support**  
  Add seamless handling of both `.onnx` and `.joblib` models with built-in feature mapping.

- **Map Integration**  
  Link with an energy prediction map to import existing building geometry and simulate retrofits.

- **Custom Tab**  
  Give PlugIn standalone VIPEnergy tab so that future energy related plugins that work in the Rhino/GH environment may be added to this parent group.
