One thing we tried to work on:
- How can we gather data on plants?
- Tried multiple methods: NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and TreeCountSegHeight model
- Unfortunately, both weren't extremely successful.
- NDVI analysis was able to gather data on plants but we need more info, specifically the height of the plantst to be able to meaningfully use the data on plants.
- TreeCountSegHeight was an ML model we looked at for extracting this data. The issue we ran into with this model is that it's a big model that would slow down our energy model exponentially.
